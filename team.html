                            <p>A sophomore at University Hill Secondary and an ECF writer, Iona has always had a passion for the environment and ecosystem diversity around her. She cares deeply about rising current events about environmental issues such as ocean pollution, overfishing, and deforestation. Iona is thrilled to be able to combine her writing skills to further the reach and impact of such significant world matters. Outside of ECF, Iona can be seen attempting and failing to start painting and watching unhealthy amounts of Netflix.</p>
