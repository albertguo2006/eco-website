She started getting involved with climate change initiatives in her elementary school days and has been passionate about the environment ever since. Currently, Meredith is researching satellite technology and its agricultural usage in conserving water. Outside of ECF, Meredith can be found struggling at debate tournaments or rewatching the officeâ€”sometimes both at the same time!</p>
